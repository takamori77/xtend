Hi Patrick and Xtend Team,

Please find my Xtend Coding Challenge at:  https://github.com/takamori77/xtend

I went ahead and cut this off, as the bulk of the remaining work is service and repo unit tests -- I have done several of them as an example, the rest are pretty repetitious at this point.

Please note the following:

** This was coded in .Net Core 2 using C# 7.0

** I used vanilla Razor files for the UI

** I implemented a Repository pattern for accessing data

** I used only in memory data storage which I seeded. A database could easily be added using the provided interfaces

** Find all requirement tests in the Requirements Test Package

** I apologize for not cleaning everything up, I did the best I could given time restraints

** This project was based off the generic .Net MVC template provided by Visual Studio 2017

** No animals were hurt in the making of this production, the same cannot be said for mugs of coffee
